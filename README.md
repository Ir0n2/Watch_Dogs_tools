# Watch_Dogs_tools
I played too much watch dogs, so like the virgin I am, I won't let fiction stay fiction, I am now trying to create a bunch of watch dogs themed hacking tools. All I got right now is a shitty phishing tool though.

# Phishing_tool
goPerch is the name of our smtp phishing tool.

You got 3 options:

1: send a single phishing email to one person

2: send a single phishing email to a list of people

3: send a sms message using smtp (meaning you send a text message from your email)

# CatPhish
Have you ever noticed the sheer amount of creeps, weirdos, and losers on discord? well these chumps will click on any almost any link. 
This webserver serves a fake discord image which you can trick people into clicking. You'll want to disguise the link of course.

Or find other ways to embed it, embeding it in an image or something less suspicous could probably work really well...

# GoPhish
Really doing alot of phishing tools here. This is another webserver meant to emulate login pages. It's very simple to use and modify.
Just run the server and try localhost:8080/instagram
