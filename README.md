# Watch_Dogs_tools
I played too much watch dogs, so like the virgin I am, I won't let fiction stay fiction, I am now trying to create a bunch of watch dogs themed hacking tools. All I got right now is a shitty phishing tool though.

# Phishing_tool
goPerch is the name of our smtp phishing tool.

You got 3 options:

1: send a single phishing email to one person

2: send a single phishing email to a list of people

3: send a sms message using smtp (meaning you send a text message from your email)
